  Adds a permanent managed vSphere agent to Jenkins. \
  This is called "managed" because Jenkins can perform vSphere-specific actions (e.g. to revert the agent back to a previous state) upon build completion etc. \
  Use this if you have defined permanent virtual machines in your vSphere cloud and want Jenkins to handle them. \
  If you want Jenkins to create, use and destroy machines "on demand" then you should use the Cloud functionality and define a Jenkins agent template instead.

<div>Name of the virtual machine as it appears in vSphere. 
    <p>If more than one slave uses the same virtual machine name, only one at 
        time will be started; this would be the case where a slave machine is 
        associated with a virtual machine AND a snapshot.  This allows Jenkins 
        to use the same virtual machine but with different slave options or
        a snapshot.

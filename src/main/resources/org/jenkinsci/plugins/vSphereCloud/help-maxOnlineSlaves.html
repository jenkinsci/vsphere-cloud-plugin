<div>
Maximum number of virtual machines that this vSphere Cloud may use at one time.<br/>
A value of 0 indicates no maximum value.<br/>
If there are more VMs running (in total - not just ones started by the vSphere plugin)
than the maximum then the vSphere Cloud plug-in will not
start up further VMs.

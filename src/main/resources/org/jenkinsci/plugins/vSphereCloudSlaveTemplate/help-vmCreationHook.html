<div>
If set, specifies a command to be run on the master shortly after a VM has been started.
Standard variable substitution is in force, plus the variable VSPHERE_IP will be set to the IP address of the VM.
<p>
This command is executed after the VM has been created, and after its IP address is known, but before the slave computer is released into Jenkins' control.
Any command run from here MUST complete quickly.
The exit code and output from the process will be logged in the vSphere log.
</p>
Note: 
It is an acknowledged problem that debugging slave issues is problematic when the slaves are disposed of shortly after the issue occurs.
This field, and its sibling, are intended as an aide to debugging such issues.
They are <em>not</em> intended as robust production-scale functionality.

<div>
Uses the vSphere "GuestInfo" data object to pass information to the newly-cloned virtual machine.
The guest operating system can retrieve this information using the <tt>vmtoolsd</tt> utility.
<br>
e.g. Passing in a GuestInfo property named
"<tt>JNLPURL</tt>"
with value
"<tt>${JENKINS_URL}computer/${NODE_NAME}/slave-agent.jnlp</tt>"
could tell a virtual machine what URL to connect to in order to run the Jenkins slave.jar agent,
and the virtual machine could retrieve that information using the command
<tt>vmtoolsd --cmd "info-get guestinfo.JNLPURL"</tt>.
<p>
Variables which can be used within the values of these properties include
<ul>
<li>All variables from the Jenkins global configuration, e.g. environment variables.</li>
<li>All variables exposed from "this" node's own properties, e.g. tool locations.</li>
<li>Environment variables available in build steps that are not build-dependent:
<tt>JENKINS_URL</tt>,
<tt>NODE_NAME</tt>,
<tt>NODE_LABELS</tt>.
</li>
<li>The value to be passed with the <tt>-secret</tt> argument if the agent is connecting via JNLP: <tt>JNLP_SECRET</tt>.</li>
<li>The following properties from this vSphere template definition:
<tt>cluster</tt>,
<tt>datastore</tt>,
<tt>labelString</tt>,
<tt>masterImageName</tt>,
<tt>remoteFS</tt>,
<tt>snapshotName</tt>,
<tt>targetHost</tt>,
<tt>templateDescription</tt>.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
Note: This is not a list of properties that are exposed as GuestInfo properties by default.
The above list is a list of variables that <em>may</em> be used in the GuestInfo properties.
By default, no GuestInfo properties are passed.

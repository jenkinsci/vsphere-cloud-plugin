  Linked clones will re-use any read-only disk backings (like snapshots) and create new children for your clone.
  This requires that you have at least one snapshot in your master image.
  <br/>
  Enabling this will save (a lot of) time starting the clone, but the disk backings will be shared (reducing performance).

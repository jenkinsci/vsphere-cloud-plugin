Says whether to use the agent once and then immediately dispose of it, or to keep the agent until it is no longer required.
<ul>
<li>If you use the run-once strategy, you should ensure that there is only 1 executor.</li>
<li>If you use the keep-until-idle strategy, you should ensure that "disconnect after limited builds" is disabled (set to 0).</li>
</ul>
Both these options have an idle timeout (in minutes) after which to kill the slave, but for a run-once strategy, this is only a fail-safe if the agent fails to connect.
Normally a run-once agent will be terminated immediately after it has completed its one-and-only job.

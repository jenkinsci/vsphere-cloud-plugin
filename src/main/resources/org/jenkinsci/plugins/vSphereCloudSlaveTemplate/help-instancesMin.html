<div>
    The number of VMs to be provisioned beforehand.<br>
    This allows to speed up CI runs by starting them immediately without waiting for a VM to get booted.<br>
    <dt>If the number set to 0:</dt>
    <dd>No VMs provisioned in advance.</dd>
    <dt>If the number is bigger than 0:</dt>
    <dd>The plugin provisions new VMs to meet the value.</dd>
    <dt>If Keep-Until-Idle retention strategy is used along with this option:</dt>
    <dd>Busy VMs are counted as reuseable, so the plugin will not provision more VMs even if all of them are currently busy.</dd>
    <dt>If Run-Once retention strategy is used along with this option:</dt>
    <dd>Busy VMs are counted as non reusable, so the plugin will provision more VMs to meet the value.<br>
        When at maximum capacity new VM will be added after an old VM is gone.</dd>
    <dt>If instances Min is bigger than instance Cap:</dt>
    <dd>The plugin will provision max number of VMs specified in instance Cap (the smallest of cloud and template options).</dd>
    The plugin checks the number of running VMs once in 2 minutes.

<div>
If set, specifies a command to be run on the master before a VM will be destroyed.
Standard variable substitution is in force, plus the variable VSPHERE_IP will be set to the IP address of the VM.
<p>
This command is executed after Jenkins has determined that it should dispose of the slave, but before the VM is deleted.
For optimal build performance, any command run from here should complete quickly,
as any delay will result in the VM continuing to exist and hence count against the instance totals,
reducing build throughput.
The exit code and output from the process will be logged in the vSphere log.

Note: 
It is an acknowledged problem that debugging slave issues is problematic when the slaves are disposed of shortly after the issue occurs.
This field, and its sibling, are intended as an aide to debugging such issues.
They are <em>not</em> intended as robust production-scale functionality.

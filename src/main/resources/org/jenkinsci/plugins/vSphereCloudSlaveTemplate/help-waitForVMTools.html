	If enabled, Jenkins will wait for VMware Tools to become active before
	continuing with the slave connection process.
	<p>This effectively makes the Launch Delay timer to be relative to
		the time when the virtual machine is "up" rather than requiring a
		longer Launch Delay timer (to cope with variations in startup speeds).
	</p>
	This must not be set if VMware Tools is not installed on the virtual
	machine.

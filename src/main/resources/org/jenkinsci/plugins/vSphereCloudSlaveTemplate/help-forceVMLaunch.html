	If you are using a Launch method where the slave connects to the
	master, e.g. Java Web Start, then tick this box.
	<p>
		Each launch method tells Jenkins whether or not the Jenkins master can
		initiate the process itself or not. In the case of "passive" methods
		where the Jenkins master takes no action itself, Jenkins will be
		(mis)informed that it is unable to take action to start the slave. <br />
		This flag overrides that information. <br /> This is appropriate for
		cloud-provisioned slaves because the act of creating the slave (which
		the Jenkins master can do) should trigger the slave's connection.
